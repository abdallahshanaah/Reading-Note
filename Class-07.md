###  Domain Modeling
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors
+ Model epic fails videos
+ Define a constructor and initialize properties
To define the same properties between many objects, you'll want to use a constructor function. Below is a table that summarizes a JavaScript representation of an EpicFailVideo object.
and you can see the constructor function is defined using a **function expression**
After the constructor function definition, two objects are instantiated with the new keyword and their properties are initialized by calling the EpicFailVideo constructor function. After being instantiated and initialized, these objects are stored inside the parkourFail and corgiFail variables.
+ Generate random numbers **Math.random()**
