### Shay Howeâ€™s intro to RWD
**Responsive Web Design**
Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop.
**Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile**
For some the term responsive may not be new, and others might be even more acquainted with the terms adaptive or mobile. Which may leave you wondering what exactly is the difference between all of them.
**Flexible Layouts**
Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, including flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media. The first part, flexible layouts, is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width.
1. Relative Viewport Lengths
2. Flexible Grid
**Media Queries**
Media queries were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles. 
- Initializing Media Queries : There are a couple different ways to use media queries, using the @media rule inside of an existing style sheet 
- Logical Operators in Media Queries : ogical operators in media queries help build powerful expressions. There are three different logical operators available for use within media queries, including and, not, and only.
- Media Features in Media Queries : Knowing the media query syntax and how logical operators work is a great introduction to media queries but the true work comes with media features.
- Height & Width Media Features : One of the most common media features revolves around determining a height or width for a device or browser viewport.

 ### All About Floats 
 **Float** is a CSS positioning property. To understand its purpose and origin, we can look to print design
 *What are floats used for?*
Aside from the simple example of wrapping text around images, floats can be used to create entire web layouts.
**Clearing the Float**
Float's sister property is clear. An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float. Again an illustration probably does more good than words do.
