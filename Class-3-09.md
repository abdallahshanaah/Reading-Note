  # Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript
  **What is functional programming?**
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs 
**pure function**
it is talking about what is the pure function and some example to exaplen what is mean 
and the benefits of it 
1. Immutability When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.
**pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency**
2. Functions as first-class entities 
Functions as first-class entities can:
* refer to it from constants and variables
* pass it as a parameter to other functions
* return it as result from other functions
3. Higher-order functions
that mean 
* takes one or more functions as arguments, or
* returns a function as its result
 **Filter**
 **Map**
 **Reduce**
